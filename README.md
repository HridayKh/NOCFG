# NOCFG 🔧

**NOCFG** (No Configuration Generator) is a lightweight Java-based CLI that helps you:
- 🏗️ Create new projects (React, Java, Cloudflare Workers)
- 🧪 Test them automatically
- 🚀 Deploy with a single command
All without touching config files. Ever.

---

## 🧠 Why?

Tired of repeating boilerplate?  
Hate configuring CI/CD for the 100th time?  
Want GitHub auto-setup, project bootstraps, and deploys with a single command?

**NOCFG has you covered.**

## 💻 Features (WIP)

- `nocfg make <type> <name> (path)` — bootstraps your project
- `nocfg test (path)` — runs the appropriate test pipeline
- `nocfg push` / `nocfg submit` — deploys the project
- Alias support (`nocfg` → `ncf`, etc.)

---

## 🌱 Status

- This project is early-stage and growing fast.
- Expect rapid changes and cool features every week.
- Built for devs who hate config.
