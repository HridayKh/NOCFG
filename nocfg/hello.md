🧰 Day 2 of building NOCFG — my no-config dev CLI

Ever spend 20+ minutes just setting up a GitHub repo, boilerplate, and CI… before you even write a line of code?

Same.

That’s why I’m building NOCFG — a CLI tool that spins up React apps, Cloudflare Workers, and Java projects with:

    🧪 Tests pre-wired

    🚀 CI/CD ready

    📁 Folder structure done

    🌐 GitHub repo set
    —all in one command.

⚙️ Todays Goals:
    CLI foundation using Picocli
    commands parse properly ✅
    Clean exit codes (because CI is picky)
    Easily testable CLI shell — fast to iterate
    Still early days, but the engine’s revving 👨‍💻

If you:
    Hate writing .github/workflows from scratch
    Reuse the same boilerplate for the 100th time
    Just want to code, not configure

Then I’m building this tool for you.

📍Built in Java. Open-source. Fast as hell.
